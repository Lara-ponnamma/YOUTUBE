# YOUTUBE

Problem Statement:

In response to YouTube's decision to hide dislike counts, we conduct an EDA on the YouTube dislikes dataset, focusing on trending videos in the USA, Canada, and Great Britain from August 2020 to December 2021.
The primary challenge is to derive insights from this dataset, which contains valuable information on likes, views, comments, and dislikes, and was last updated just before YouTube's API restricted access to dislikes data.
We aim to uncover hidden patterns and trends, offering a unique perspective on YouTube's user behavior and content dynamics.
This EDA is particularly relevant for content creators, businesses, and researchers interested in understanding YouTube's evolving landscape.

Objective:

Our central objective is to perform a detailed EDA using NumPy and Pandas on the YouTube dislikes dataset, which includes data from trending videos in the USA, Canada, and Great Britain.
The specific goals include data cleaning, computation of descriptive statistics, analysis of temporal trends, channel identification, tags exploration, correlation analysis, and geographic comparisons.
By achieving these objectives, we seek to gain insights into user engagement, content popularity, and YouTube's changing environment.
This EDA serves as a valuable resource for those interested in data-driven insights on YouTube content strategy and user preferences.


Conclusion:

In conclusion, this EDA provides comprehensive insights, starting with meticulous data cleaning and a profound understanding of metrics distributions, including likes, views, comments, and dislikes.
Temporal analysis reveals YouTube's evolving landscape and how user behavior changed during the specified timeframe.
Channel identification and tags exploration provide valuable insights into content strategies.
Correlations between metrics and geographic comparisons offer a nuanced perspective, making this EDA a valuable resource for content creators, businesses, and researchers seeking to adapt to YouTube's dynamic environment and harness data-driven insights.
